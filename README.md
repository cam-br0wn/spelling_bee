# Spelling Bee in C

## About

This is a copy of the popular NYT game Spelling Bee, written largely by ChatGPT, in C. At present, it has only been tested on Intel-based MacOS.

## Todo
- Implement hint functionality
- Implement table showing guessed words and prefixes of unguessed
- Find a way less shitty dictionary
- Make the word-selection criteria more strict. Maybe find/use a frequency dictionary todo this.
